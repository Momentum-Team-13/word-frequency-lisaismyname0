we will be manipulating strings in python

refer to the jupyter notebooks (notebook 7) section on:
- sequences
- string methods
- how to replace

also see: how to read files (book 9)

in python opening and reading files are not the same thing

if "__name__" == "__main__"
^ this makes it so you can the program from the command line and you are able to pass it the name of a file
eg:
python word_frequency.py simple-test-file.txt (must
 be in directory for this to work)

write function so it works on any file

list of steps:
(a lot of this is from the string methods notebooks)
- remove punctuation using item.replace()
- file.split("")
    this will split the reading into individual word items
    - from here can i make each word 1/2 of a tuple where the word is the key and then i designate it a value of 0
    (look into using popitem() but this may or may not allow you specify which item... del mioght work!)
    - this will also allow me to delete all of my stop words (along with their value of 0) out of my dictionary
        -would it hurt to do this at the end?
        does it matter?
- file.lower()
    normalize to lowercase
- stop words
    make a loop that cycles through the stop words and write code to skip over them
- go through file and keep count of how often each word is used
    word value starts = 0

    as word appears, value += 1
    or word_count_list.append(*)
    and then show quantity of []
    (following example in read me)
